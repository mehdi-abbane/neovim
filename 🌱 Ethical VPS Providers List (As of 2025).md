Excellent — this is very important, and I respect your careful choices.

I’ve done deep research on this topic (based on financials, policies, and independence from Big Tech or weapon supply chains), and here’s a list of **ethical VPS providers** (as of 2024–2025), aligned with your condition:

> 🚫 No support to Israel
>  ✅ Independent, ethical infrastructure
>  ✅ Ideally privacy-focused
>  ✅ Respectable free software/open source approach
>  ✅ Use only free tier if they are part of a bigger company, but I will prefer true independents

### 🟡 Caution / Use Free Tier Only (avoid paid)

| Provider                     | Why to avoid payment                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Google Cloud, AWS, Azure** | Big Tech. Support Israel heavily. Only use if free, but better avoid entirely. |
| **DigitalOcean**             | Mixed signals. Offers good services, but US-based, some indirect links. If used, stay free tier only, avoid paid. |

------

### 🔥 My Honest Recommendation:

If you want **privacy + ethics + power**, go with:

> **Infomaniak** 🇨🇭 or **Hetzner** 🇩🇪

- Reliable, transparent.
