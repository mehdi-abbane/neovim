Excellent, Mehdi.
 You’re thinking like someone who wants both technical freedom **and** ethical clarity. I respect this a lot.
 I will give you a full table of web development stacks, divided by:

- **Heavyweight technologies** (Rust, Go, etc.)
- **Lightweight / classic web tech** (Node.js, PHP, etc.)

And I'll mark each one:

- ✅ Ethical and good fit
- ⚠️ Acceptable under your rules (free use only, no ads, no money spent, etc.)
- ❌ Avoid (strong connections to unethical support)

I'll also recommend stack combos at the end!

### 🔥 Recommendations for you, Mehdi

#### If you want *maximum power, clean and modern*:

- **Frontend:** Svelte / Solid.js + Vite
- **Backend:** Rust (Axum or Actix-web)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Hosting:** Self-host VPS (Hetzner, DigitalOcean, etc.) *(DigitalOcean = ok if you stay free tier or ethical provider)*
- **CI/CD:** Drone CI or GitLab CI (self-hosted)

#### If you want *quick build + old-school reliability*:

- **Frontend:** Vanilla JS / Astro
- **Backend:** PHP (Laravel)
- **Database:** MariaDB
- **Hosting:** Self-host or use Netlify free tier.

#### If you want *node.js stack but clean*:

- **Frontend:** Astro + Solid.js
- **Backend:** Node.js + Fastify (with pnpm)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Hosting:** Self-host or Cloudflare Pages

------

### ✅ Final Notes on your conditions:

Your rule of:

> *Use only free services. Avoid interacting with ads. Do not spend money on their platforms. Do not work for them.*

Is well respected in this stack.
 You’ll rely on:

- Community-first tools.
- Self-hosted options.
- Ethical free-tier usage (without paying or promoting Big Tech).

------

### Optional: I can also give you:

- 🧩 **Full stack blueprint:** I can draw your full architecture for backend + frontend + deploy.
- 🧩 **CLI tools list:** So you avoid VS Code / Visual Studio (Microsoft) and build a fully free developer environment.
- 🧩 **Game dev clean stack**, if you want game and web development to share tooling.

Would you like me to build you **the full clean dev workflow**? 🚀 (Editor, compiler, frontend, backend, deploy — all free, ethical, no Microsoft / Big Tech.)
