Excellent question ‚Äî because hosting is where a lot of hidden ethical concerns live (tracking, ads, corporate ownership, etc.).
 Since you want to **avoid supporting unethical companies**, **use only free services of a provider**, and **self-host when possible**, I‚Äôll give you a good clean table for **web app hosting** too.

I'll also give options for different levels (static sites, full web apps, and backend APIs).

### **Ethical Web App Hosting Options**

| Purpose                               | Provider                     | Status | Notes                                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Static Site Hosting**               | **Netlify (Free Tier)**      | ‚úÖ      | Free tier is solid, no ads. But avoid paid tiers and upsells. |
|                                       | **Cloudflare Pages**         | ‚úÖ      | Free tier, privacy-focused, no ads. Highly recommended.      |

|                                       | **Coolify (Self-hosted)**    | ‚úÖ      | Open-source alternative to services like Heroku. Self-host for max control. |
|                                       | **CapRover (Self-hosted)**   | ‚úÖ      | Easy-to-use PaaS you can self-host. Very ethical.            |
| **Backend-Only (APIs, DBs, Workers)** | **Supabase (Free Tier)**     | ‚úÖ      | Open-source Firebase alternative. Use free tier only.        |

### Notes:

- ‚úÖ **Highly recommended**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Acceptable only if you have no better choice**
- ‚ùå **Avoid** (not listed in table to keep it clean ‚Äî like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)

### If you want **maximum ethics and control**, I strongly recommend:

- **Self-hosting** on ethical VPS providers like **Hetzner**, **Contabo**, or **Scaleway** (make sure to review their ethical standings yourself).
- Use **Cloudflare Pages** for frontend static hosting.
- Pair it with **CapRover** or **Coolify** for backend apps.
- Use **Postgres** or **SQLite** for databases.

------

### Suggested Ethical Stack for a Web App:

- **Frontend**: Static assets on **Cloudflare Pages**
- **Backend**: API on **Fly.io** or **Coolify**
- **Database**: **Postgres** (self-hosted) or **SQLite**
- **Domain & DNS**: **Njalla** or **Cloudflare DNS**

If you tell me the exact type of app you‚Äôre building (for example: real-time app, e-commerce, multiplayer game dashboard, etc.), I can give you an even **more specific recommendation** that fits your needs and ethics 100%. üöÄ

Would you like me to build a **full stack setup** for you as well? (frontend, backend, DB, CI/CD, hosting ‚Äî all ethical üå±)
